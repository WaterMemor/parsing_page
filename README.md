# parsing_page
Working with Excel spreadsheets is very important for small businesses. I had to face uploading photos from web pages using a link from an Excel file. So i used pandas read_excel and bs4. After that I will upload photos from the folder in 1С.

Later I created another parsing for the site https://igr.ru/catalog/13037/984417/. Since the customer did not fill in some of the fields from this supplier, my task was to get the brand of the toy. This time I didn’t need to download photos, but only write all brands in Excel.
